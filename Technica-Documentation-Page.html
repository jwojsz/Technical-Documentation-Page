        <div>
        <p><strong>Software development is the process of conceiving, specifying, designing, programming, documenting, testing, and bug fixing involved in creating and maintaining applications, frameworks, or other software components.</strong> Software development is a process of writing and maintaining the source code, but in a broader sense, it includes all that is involved between the conception of the desired software through to the final manifestation of the software, sometimes in a planned and structured process. Therefore, software development may include research, new development, prototyping, modification, reuse, re-engineering, maintenance, or any other activities that result in software products.</p>
        <p>A software development process (also known as a <em>software development methodology, model, or life cycle</em>) is a framework that is used to structure, plan, and control the process of developing information systems. A wide variety of such frameworks has evolved over the years, each with its own recognized strengths and weaknesses. There are several different approaches to software development: some take a more structured, engineering-based approach to develop business solutions, whereas others may take a more incremental approach, where software evolves as it is developed piece-by-piece. One system development methodology is not necessarily suitable for use by all projects. Each of the available methodologies is best suited to specific kinds of projects, based on various technical, organizational, project and team considerations.</p>

        <p>Most methodologies share some combination of the following stages of software development:</p>
        <ol><strong>
          <li>Gathering requirements</li>
          <li>Plan</li>
          <li>Design</li>
          <li>Implementation</li>
          <li>Testing</li>
          <li>Deployment</li>
          <li>Maintenance</li>

        <header><h2>Gathering Requirements</h2></header>
        <p>The sources of ideas for software products are plentiful. These ideas can come from market research including the demographics of potential new customers, existing customers, sales prospects who rejected the product, other internal software development staff, or a creative third party. Ideas for software products are usually first evaluated by marketing personnel for economic feasibility, for fit with existing channels distribution, for possible effects on existing product lines, required features, and for fit with the company's marketing objectives. In a marketing evaluation phase, the cost and time assumptions become evaluated. A decision is reached early in the first phase as to whether, based on the more detailed information generated by the marketing and development staff, the project should be pursued further.</p>
        <p>Because software development may involve compromising or going beyond what is required by the client, a software development project may stray into less technical concerns such as:</p>
        <ul><em>
          <li>Human resources</li>
          <li>Risk management</li>
          <li>Budgeting</li>
          <li>Intellectual property</li>
          </em></ul>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="plan">
        <header><h2>Plan</h2></header>
        <p>Planning is an objective of each and every activity, where we want to discover things that belong to the project. An important task in creating a software program is extracting the requirements or requirements analysis. Customers typically have an abstract idea of what they want as an end result but do not know what software should do. Skilled and experienced software engineers recognize incomplete, ambiguous, or even contradictory requirements at this point. Frequently demonstrating live code may help reduce the risk that the requirements are incorrect.</p>
        <p>Once the general requirements are gathered from the client, an analysis of the scope of the development should be determined and clearly stated. This is often called a scope document.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="design">
        <header><h2>Design</h2></header>
        <p>Once the requirements are established, the design of the software can be established in a software design document. This involves a preliminary or high-level design of the main modules with an overall picture (such as a block diagram) of how the parts fit together. The language, operating system, and hardware components should all be known at this time. Then a detailed or low-level design is created, perhaps with prototyping as proof-of-concept or to firm up requirements.</p>
        <p>Prototyping has several benefits: the software designer and implementer can get valuable feedback from the users early in the project. The client and the contractor can compare if the software made matches the software specification, according to which the software program is built. It also allows the software engineer some insight into the accuracy of initial project estimates and whether the deadlines and milestones proposed can be successfully met.</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="implementation">
        <header><h2>Implementation</h2></header>
        <p>An implementation is a realization of a technical specification or algorithm as a program, software component, or other computer system through computer programming and deployment. Many implementations may exist for a given specification or standard. For example, web browsers contain implementations of World Wide Web Consortium-recommended specifications, and software development tools contain implementations of programming languages.</p>
        <p>A special case occurs in object-oriented programming, when a concrete class implements an interface; in this case the concrete class is an implementation of the interface and it includes methods which are implementations of those methods specified by the interface.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="testing">
        <header><h2>Testing</h1></header>
        <p>Software testing is an integral and important phase of the software development process. This part of the process ensures that defects are recognized as soon as possible. In some processes, generally known as test-driven development, tests may be developed just before implementation and serve as a guide for the implementation's correctness.</p>
      <section class="main-section" id="deployment">
        <header><h2>Deployment</h2></header>
        <p>Deployment starts directly after the code is appropriately tested, approved for release, and sold or otherwise distributed into a production environment. This may involve installation, customization (<em>such as by setting parameters to the customer's values</em>), testing, and possibly an extended period of evaluation.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="maintenance">
        <header><h2>Maintenance</h2></header>
        <p>Maintaining and enhancing software to cope with newly discovered faults or requirements can take substantial time and effort, as missed requirements may force redesign of the software. In most cases maintenance is required on regular basis to fix reported issues and keep the software running.</p>
